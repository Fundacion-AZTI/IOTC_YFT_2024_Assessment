\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Executive Summary}

This report presents a preliminary stock assessment for Indian Ocean
yellowfin tuna (\emph{Thunnus albacares}) using Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3).
The assessment uses an age-structured and spatially-explicit population
model and is fitted to catch rate indices, length-composition data, and
tagging data. The assessment covers 1950 -- 2023 and represents an
update of the previous assessment model, taking into account progress
and improvements made since the previous assessment. The assessment
assumes that the Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna constitute a single
spawning stock, modelled as spatially disaggregated four regions, with
21 fisheries. Standardized CPUE series from the main longline fleets
1975 -- 2020 were included in the models as the relative abundance index
of exploitable biomass in each region. The CPUE indices from EU Purse
seine sets on free schools were included in a subset of models with the
spatial and fleet structure revised to better accommodate the
distribution and size structure of the purse seine fisheries. Indices
based on associative and non-associative dynamics of yellowfin tuna with
floating objects were also available, and the utility of these indices
was examined in the assessment. Tag release and recovery data from the
RTTP-IO program were included in the model to inform abundance,
movement, and mortality rates.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Prior to 2008, Indian Ocean (IO) yellowfin tuna (\emph{Thunnus
albacares}) was assessed using methods such as Virtual Population
Analysis (VPA) and production models
(\citeproc{ref-nishidaStockAssessmentYellowfin2007}{Nishida and Shono
2007}, \citeproc{ref-nishidaStockAssessmentYellowfin2005}{2005}). In
2008, a preliminary stock assessment of IO yellowfin tuna was conducted
using MULTIFAN-CL
(\citeproc{ref-langleyPreliminaryStockAssessment2008}{Langley et al.
2008}) enabling the integration of the tag release/recovery data
collected from the large-scale tagging programme conducted in the IO in
the preceding years. The MULTIFAN-CL assessment was revised and updated
in the following years
(\citeproc{ref-langleyStockAssessmentYellowfin2009}{Langley et al.
2009}; \citeproc{ref-langleyStockAssessmentYellowfin2010}{Langley,
Herrera, and Million 2010},
\citeproc{ref-langleyStockAssessmentYellowfin2011}{2011},
\citeproc{ref-langleyStockAssessmentYellowfin2012}{2012}).

In 2015, the assessment of IO yellowfin tuna was implemented
(\citeproc{ref-langleyStockAssessmentYellowfin2015}{Langley 2015}),
which used the Stock Synthesis 3 modelling platform
(\citeproc{ref-methotStockSynthesisBiological2013}{Methot and Wetzel
2013}). SS3 is conceptually very similar to MFCL and the two platforms
have yielded similar results. On basis of that assessment, the yellowfin
tuna stock was determined to be overfished and subject to overfishing.
At its 20th meeting, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) adopted an
Interim Plan for Rebuilding the Indian Ocean Yellowfin Tuna Stock (Res.
16/01).

The SS3 assessment was updated in 2016
(\citeproc{ref-langleyUpdate2015Indian2016}{Langley 2016}) and was
revised and updated in 2018
(\citeproc{ref-fuPreliminaryIndianOcean2018}{Fu et al. 2018}). These
assessments utilised new composite longline CPUE indices derived from
the main distant water longline fleets, replacing the Japanese longline
CPUE indices used previously. The 2018 assessment also included a
comprehensive analysis of the main assumptions of the stock assessment.
A model ensemble covering major components of structural uncertainty was
used to characterise the stock status. The assessment estimated that the
spawning stock biomass in 2017 was below \(SSB_{MSY}\), and that fishing
mortality was above \(F_{MSY}\). Therefore, the stock status was
determined to remain overfished and experiencing overfishing.

An external review of the 2018 assessment provided recommendations to
improve model parametrisations
(\citeproc{ref-methotRecommendationsConfigurationIndian2019}{Methot
2019}). An attempt was made to update the assessment in 2019, with
extensive investigations of alternative spatial structures, data
weighting and biological parameters
(\citeproc{ref-urtizbereaPRELIMINARYASSESSMENTINDIAN2019}{Urtizberea et
al. 2019}). Further analysis was conducted in 2020 to refine the process
of model selection through an objective scoring system based on
diagnostic metrics
(\citeproc{ref-urtizbereaProvidingScientificAdvice2020}{Urtizberea et
al. 2020}).

The most recent assessment was conducted in 2021
(\citeproc{ref-fuPreliminaryIndianYellowfin2021}{Fu et al. 2021}), which
also used SS3 as the modelling platform and was based on the four area
spatial configuration as in 2018. This recent assessment included an
standardised CPUE series from the main longline fleets as the main
index, but also tested the inclusion of EU purse seine indices,
operating on free schools and floating objects, and an index from the
Maldivian pole and line fishery. A range of exploratory models were
presented to address issues in observational datasets, improve the
stability of the assessment model, and explore the effects of
alternative model assumptions. Overall stock status estimates do not
differ substantially from the 2018 assessment, estimating
\(SSB/SSB_{MSY}=0.78\) and \(F/F_{MSY}=1.27\) for the last model year,
which suggest that the stock is overfished and experiencing overfishing.

An external review of the 2021 assessment was carried out in 2023
(\citeproc{ref-maunderIndependentReviewRecent2023}{Maunder et al.
2023}), and provided a set of recommendations for the next assessment
implementation. This report documents the next iteration of the stock
assessment of the IO yellowfin tuna stock for consideration at the 26th
WPTT meeting. This stock assessment includes fishery and biological data
up to the end of 2023 and its configuration is based on the 2021
assessment. It implements an age- and spatially-structured population
model using SS3 (v3.30.22.1) and incorporates some revisions made by the
last external review.

\section{Background}\label{background}

\subsection{Biology}\label{biology}

Yellowfin tuna is a cosmopolitan species distributed mainly in the
tropical and subtropical oceanic waters of the three major oceans, where
it forms large schools. Spawning occurs mainly from December to March in
lower latitudes with warmer waters and mesoscale oceanographic activity
(\citeproc{ref-muhlingReproductionLarvalBiology2017}{Muhling et al.
2017}), with the main spawning grounds west of 75\(^\circ\)E. However,
spawning activity has also been reported in the Oman Sea
(\citeproc{ref-hosseiniInvestigationsReproductiveBiology2016}{Hosseini
and Kaymaram 2016}), Bay of Bengal
(\citeproc{ref-kumarReproductiveDynamicsYellowfin2022}{Kumar and Ghosh
2022}), off Sri Lanka and the Mozambique Channel, and in the eastern IO
off Australia Nootmorn, Yakoh, and Kawises
(\citeproc{ref-nootmornReproductiveBiologyYellowfin2005}{2005}). The
size at 50\% maturity for this species in the IO was initially estimated
at around 75 cm based on cortical alveolar stage
(\citeproc{ref-zudaireReproductivePotentialYellowfin2013}{Zudaire et al.
2013}), but an updated study suggests that it might be at a larger size
(\(\sim\) 101 cm)
(\citeproc{ref-zudairePreliminaryEstimatesSex2022}{Zudaire et al.
2022}). Tag recoveries provide evidence of large movements of yellowfin
tuna within the western equatorial region; however, few observations of
large-scale transverse movements in the IO have been reported
(\citeproc{ref-gaertnerTagSheddingTropical2015}{Gaertner and Hallier
2015}). Yellowfin dwell preferentially in the surface mixed layer and
the thermocline (\citeproc{ref-pecoraroPuttingAllPieces2017}{Pecoraro et
al. 2017}), above 200 m approximately
(\citeproc{ref-sabarrosVerticalBehaviorHabitat2015}{Sabarros, Romanov,
and Bach 2015}).

This species has a high metabolic rate and, therefore, it requires large
energy supplies to fulfill the bioenergetics demands for movement,
growth, and reproduction
(\citeproc{ref-artetxe-arrateReviewFisheriesLife2021}{Artetxe-Arrate et
al. 2021}). Feeding behaviour is largely opportunistic, with a variety
of prey species being consumed, including large concentrations of
crustacean that have occurred recently in the tropical areas and small
mesopelagic fishes
(\citeproc{ref-krishnanDietCompositionFeeding2024}{Krishnan et al.
2024}; \citeproc{ref-rogerRelationshipsYellowfinSkipjack1994}{Roger
1994}; \citeproc{ref-duffyGlobalTrophicEcology2017}{Duffy et al. 2017}).
Recent growth studies have generally supported a two-stanza growth
curve, with a slow initial growth phase up to \(\sim\) 60 cm followed by
much faster growth
(\citeproc{ref-farleyUpdatingEstimationAge2023}{Farley et al. 2023}). In
addition, differences in mean length-at-age have been identified between
males and females for fish older than four years. Environmental
variability in the IO impacts the abundance and catch rates of this
species. A significant negative association between the Indian Ocean
Dipoles (IODs) and the catch rates of yellowfin tuna with a periodicity
of approximately four years was observed
(\citeproc{ref-lanEffectsClimateVariability2013}{Lan, Evans, and Lee
2013}; \citeproc{ref-lanInfluenceOceanographicClimatic2020}{Lan, Chang,
and Wu 2020}). Likewise, Lan, Chang, and Wu
(\citeproc{ref-lanInfluenceOceanographicClimatic2020}{2020}) also found
that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) had an impact on catch
rates near the Arabian Sea.

\subsection{Stock structure}\label{stock-structure}

Fisheries information indicates that adult yellowfin are distributed
continuously throughout the entire tropical Indian Ocean, but some more
detailed analysis of fisheries data suggests that the stock structure
may be more complex. The tag recoveries may indicate that the western
and eastern regions of the IO support relatively discrete
sub-populations of yellowfin tuna. Studies of stock structure using DNA
techniques have indicated that there may be genetically discrete
subpopulations of yellowfin tuna in the northwestern IO
(\citeproc{ref-dammannagodaEvidenceFineGeographical2008}{Dammannagoda,
Hurwood, and Mather 2008}) and within Indian waters
(\citeproc{ref-kunalMitochondrialDNAAnalysis2013}{Kunal et al. 2013}). A
recent study of stock structure using the gene sequencing technology
along with a basin-scale sampling design indicated genetic
differentiation between north and south of the equator within the IO,
and possibly additional genetic structure within the locations north of
the equator (\citeproc{ref-greweGeneticPopulationConnectivity2020}{Grewe
et al. 2020}). Parasite composition and abundance suggest limited
movement of yellowfin between Indonesian archipelago (eastern IO) and
the Maldives (central IO)
(\citeproc{ref-mooreMovementJuvenileTuna2019}{Moore et al. 2019}).
Isotope studies have also suggested relatively limited movement, with
resident behaviour at the temporal scale of their muscle turnover
(\(\sim\) 3 months)
(\citeproc{ref-menardIsotopicEvidenceDistinct2007}{Ménard et al. 2007}).
Otolith chemistry analyses concluded that fisheries operating in the
western IO are mainly composed of fish with western origin, which
suggest limited movement from east to west
(\citeproc{ref-artetxe-arrateOtolithStableIsotopesinreview}{Artetxe-Arrate
et al. in review}). These studies generally support the potential
presence of population units of yellowfin tuna within the IO, despite
that considerable uncertainty remains on sub-regional population
structure in this region. This assessment assumes that the IO yellowfin
tuna stock consists of several interconnected regional populations
Figure~\ref{fig-4A-config} that have the same biological
characteristics; however, we acknowledge that more studies are needed to
reveal the structure of this species.

\subsection{Fisheries}\label{fisheries}

Yellowfin tuna are harvested with a diverse variety of gear types, from
small-scale artisanal fisheries (in the Arabian Sea, Mozambique Channel
and waters around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Lakshadweep
Islands) to large gillnetters (from Oman, Iran and Pakistan operating
mostly but not exclusively in the Arabian Sea) and distant-water
longliners and purse seiners that operate widely in equatorial and
tropical waters (ADD FIGURE CATCH). Purse seiners and gillnetters catch
a wide size range of yellowfin tuna, whereas the longline fishery takes
mostly adult fish (ADD FIGURE CATCH).

Prior to 1980, annual catches of yellowfin tuna remained below about
80,000 mt and were dominated by longline catches
(Figure~\ref{fig-catch-bar}). Annual catches increased markedly during
the 1980s and early 1990s, mainly due to the development of the
purse-seine fishery as well as an expansion of the other established
fisheries (fresh-tuna longline, gillnet, baitboat, handline and, to a
lesser extent, troll). A peak in catches was recorded in 1993, with
catches over 400,000 mt, the increase in catch almost fully attributable
to longline fleets, particularly longliners flagged in Taiwan, which
reported exceptional catches of yellowfin tuna in the Arabian Sea. The
Taiwanese longline fishery in the IO has been equipped with super-cold
storage. Since around 1986, the fleet has fished more frequently with
deep sets.

Catches declined in 1994, to about 350,000 mt, remaining at that level
for the next decade then increasing sharply to reach a peak of about
520,000 mt in 2004/2005 driven by a large increase in catch by all
fisheries, especially the purse-seine (free school) fishery. Total
annual catches declined sharply from 2004 to 2007 and remained at about
300,000 mt during 2007--2011. In 2012, total catches increased to about
400,000 mt and were maintained at about that level through 2013 to 2015.
Total catches increased to an average of 430,000 mt between 2016 and
2019, and a maximum of close to 450,000 mt in 2019
(Figure~\ref{fig-catch-bar}), despite IOTC Resolution 17/01 which
requested major fleets to substantially reduce their yellowfin catches
below the 2014 or 2015 catch level. Furthermore, catch levels of about
440,000 mt reported for 2018 might be under-estimated (to some extent)
because of changes in data processing methodology by European
Union-Spain for its purse seine fleet for that year
(\citeproc{ref-iotcReviewYellowfinTuna2021}{IOTC 2021}).

In recent years (2015--2023), purse seine has been the dominant fishing
method harvesting 36\% of the total IO yellowfin tuna catch (by weight),
with the gillnet and handline fisheries, comprising 20\% and 18\% of the
catch, respectively. There was a substantial increase in the catch by
handline in 2020 (Figure~\ref{fig-catch-bar}). A smaller component of
the catch was taken by industrial longline (5\%), and the regionally
important baitboat (4\%) and troll (4\%) fisheries. The recent increase
in the total catch has been mostly attributable to an increase in catch
from the gillnet and handline fisheries.

The purse-seine catch is generally distributed equally between
free-school and associated (log and FAD sets) schools, although the
large catches in 2003--2005 were dominated by fishing on free-schools.
Conversely, during 2015--2023 the purse-seine catch was dominated (70\%)
by the associated fishery.

Historically, most of the yellowfin catch has been taken from the
western equatorial region of the IO (44\%; region 1b, ADD IMAGE SPATIAL
CATCH) and, to a lesser extent, the Arabian Sea (26\%), the eastern
equatorial region (24\%, region 4) and the Mozambique Channel (5\%;
region 2). The purse-seine and baitboat fisheries operate almost
exclusively within the western equatorial region, while catches from the
Arabian Sea are principally by handline, gillnet, and longline (see
Figure 1). Catches from the eastern equatorial region (region 4) were
dominated by longline and gillnet (around Sri Lanka and Indonesia). The
southern IO (region 3) accounts for a small proportion of the total
yellowfin catch (1\%) taken exclusively by longline (see Figure 1).

In recent years (2008--2012), due to the threat of piracy, the bulk of
the industrial purse seine and longline fleets moved out of the western
waters of Region 1b to avoid the coastal and off-shore waters off
Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. The threat of piracy particularly affected
the freezer longline fleet and levels of effort and catch decreased
markedly from 2007. The total catch by freezing longliners declined to
about 2,000 mt in 2010, a 10-fold decrease in catch from the years
before the onset of piracy. Purse seine catches also dropped in
2007--2009 and then started to recover. Piracy off the Somali coast was
almost eliminated by 2013 but longline catches have not recovered.

The sizes caught in the IO range from 30 cm to 180 cm fork length.
Intermediate age yellowfin are seldom taken in the industrial fisheries,
but are abundant in some artisanal fisheries, mainly in the Arabian Sea.
Newly recruited fish are primarily caught by the purse seine fishery on
floating objects and the pole-and-line fishery in the Maldives. Males
are predominant in the catches of larger fish at sizes larger than 150
cm (this is also the case in other oceans). Medium sized yellowfin
concentrate for feeding in the Arabian Sea.

\section{Data}\label{data}

Catch and length information was provided by the IOTC Secretariat in a
comma-separated values (CSV) format. These datasets and the metadata can
be found online at the IOTC website:
\url{https://iotc.org/documents/WPTT/26AS/Data/01}. The catch and length
(LF) datasets were mainly composed of information about time (year and
month), CPCs, gear type, school type, and grid code. In addition, the
catch dataset had information on aggregated catch in weight (metric
tons) and numbers, while the LF dataset had information on the number of
fish sampled per fork length bin (cm) and the score of reporting quality
(RQ) estimated by the Secretariat. The fork length bin width was 2 cm
and the length bins spanned from 10 to 308 cm (i.e., a total of 150
length bins).

We processed the LF data following the next steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The number of sampled fish from 198 to 308 cm was summed and then
  assigned it to the length bin 198 cm.
\item
  We converted the length bin width from 2 to 4 cm for the stock
  assessment model. To do so, we summed the number of sampled fish from
  pairs of length bins (e.g., 10 and 12 cm were summed and assigned to
  10 cm, 14 and 16 cm were summed and assigned to 14 cm, and so on).
  After this conversion, we had a total of 48 length bins.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Spatial stratification}\label{spatial-stratification}

The grid code was available for every observation in the catch and LF
datasets, which contained information on the grid size, quadrant, and
longitude and latitude of the corner of the grid. The grid size
categories are shown in Table~\ref{tbl-grid-size} and
Figure~\ref{fig-map-grid}. The catch dataset always reported information
using a grid size of \(5^\circ\times 5^\circ\) (category 6) while the LF
dataset had diverse grid size categories. To produce the catch and
length frequency inputs for SS3, we tested two different spatial
aggregation approaches as described below.

\subsubsection{Traditional spatial
aggregation}\label{traditional-spatial-aggregation}

This is the approach used in the 2021 assessment. In order to spatially
aggregate the raw data per model area, we calculated the longitude and
latitude of the center of the grid (called centroid hereafter). Then, we
identified the model area that corresponded to a given grid based on its
centroid as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-map-grid-agg1}. Finally, we
performed the spatial aggregation by summing the catch values and the
number of sampled fish per length bin and averaging the RQ values per
model area. As described, there is no any kind of spatial weighting
during this process.

\subsubsection{Standarized spatial
aggregation}\label{standarized-spatial-aggregation}

This approach homogenized the grids in the LF dataset in standard grids
with \(5^\circ\times 5^\circ\) resolution. This standardization
procedure was not needed for the catch dataset since that information
was always reported at a \(5^\circ\times 5^\circ\) resolution. For LF
grids with larger spatial resolution than \(5^\circ\times 5^\circ\)
(i.e., categories 1, 2, 3, and 4), the number of sampled fish per length
bin was divided equally into standard grids while the RQ was repeated.
We excluded standard grids that laid completely on land. For grids with
smaller spatial resolution (i.e., category 5), the number of sampled
fish per length bin was summed and the RQ was averaged. After this
standardization procedure, we calculated the centroid of the standard
grids, which were then used to assign model areas as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-map-grid-agg2}. To perform the spatial aggregation, we
tested two methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Without weighting}: We summed the number of sampled fish per
  length bin and averaged the RQ values per model area.
\item
  \emph{With weighting}: We aggregated the length frequencies and the RQ
  through a weighting process. To do so, we identified the catch (in
  numbers) that corresponded to a given LF observation (i.e., year,
  quarter, standard grid, CPCs, and gear type). We found a perfect match
  for about \textasciitilde78\% LF observations; however, there were
  missing catch data for some LF observations. In order to fill in these
  catch gaps, we followed this imputation procedure with four levels:
\item
  Level 1: Fill in catch gaps with the average catch per grid for a
  given year, quarter, CPCs, and gear type.

\subsection{Temporal stratification}\label{temporal-stratification}

The time period covered by the assessment spanned from 1950 to 2023,
representing the period for which catch data are available from the
commercial fishing fleets. The catch and LF data was temporally
aggregated by quarter. In the assessment, we considered a quarterly time
step (\emph{quarters-as-years} approach), so having in total 296 model
time steps. Therefore, recruitment was estimated every model time step
(i.e., quarter), which allowed us to represent the continuous
recruitment of yellowfin in equatorial regions.

\subsection{Definition of fisheries}\label{definition-of-fisheries}

The assessment adopted the equivalent fisheries definitions used in the
previous stock assessments (Table~\ref{tbl-fishery-codes}). These
\emph{fisheries} represent relatively homogeneous fishing units, with
similar selectivity and catchability characteristics that do not vary
greatly over time. Twenty-one fisheries were defined based on location
(region), time period, fishing gear, purse seine set type, and type of
vessel in the case of longline fleet (Table~\ref{tbl-fleet-4Aconfig}).

The longline fishery was partitioned into two main components:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Freezing longline fisheries, or all those using drifting longlines for
  which one or more of the following three conditions apply: (i) the
  vessel hull is made up of steel; (ii) vessel length overall of 30 m or
  greater; (iii) the majority of the catches of target species are
  preserved frozen or deep-frozen. A composite longline fishery was
  defined in each region (LL 1--4) aggregating the longline catch from
  all freezing longline fleets (principally Japan and Taiwan).
\item
  Fresh-tuna longline fisheries, or all those using drifting longlines
  and made of vessels (i) having fibreglass, FRP, or wooden hull; (ii)
  having length overall less than 30 m; (iii) preserving the catches of
  target species fresh or in refrigerated seawater. A composite longline
  fishery was defined aggregating the longline catch from all fresh-tuna
  longline fleets (principally Indonesia and Taiwan) in region 4 (LF 4),
  which is where the majority of the fresh-tuna longliners have
  traditionally operated. The catches of yellowfin tuna recorded in
  regions 1 to 3 for fresh-tuna longliners, representing only 3\% of the
  total catches over the time series, were assigned to area 4.
\end{itemize}

The purse-seine catch and effort data were apportioned into two separate
method fisheries: catches from sets on associated schools of tuna (log
and drifting FAD sets; \emph{PS LS}) and from sets on unassociated
schools (free schools; \emph{PS FS}). Purse-seine fisheries operate
within regions 1a, 1b, 2 and 4 and separate purse-seine fisheries were
defined in regions 1b, 2 and 4, with the limited catch, effort and
length frequency data from region 1a reassigned to region 1b.

In the previous assessment, the region 1b purse-seine fisheries (log and
free-school) were divided into three time periods: pre-2003, 2003--2006
and post-2006. This was mainly to maintain historical consistency (the
temporal stratification was initially implemented to account for change
in the length composition during the 2000s, but no selectivity changes
were identified in the assessment and consequently the same selectivity
was shared among the three time periods. For the current assessment, the
temporal stratification was removed, reducing the 6 purse-seine
fisheries in region 1b to 2 fisheries (log and free-school).

A single baitboat fishery was defined within region 1b (essentially the
Maldives fishery). As with the purse-seine fishery, a small proportion
of the total baitboat catch and effort occurs on the periphery of region
1b, within regions 1a and 4. The additional catch was assigned to the
region 1b fishery.

Gillnet fisheries were defined in the Arabian Sea (region 1a), including
catches by Iran, Pakistan, and Oman, and in region 4 (Sri Lanka and
Indonesia). A very small proportion of the total gillnet catch and
effort occurs in region 1b, with catches and effort reassigned to area
1a.

Three troll fisheries were defined, representing separate fisheries in
regions 1b (Maldives), 2 (Comoros and Madagascar) and 4 (Sri Lanka and
Indonesia). Moderate troll catches are also taken in regions 1a and 3,
the catch and effort from this component of the fishery reassigned to
the fisheries within region 1b and 4, respectively.

A handline fishery was defined within region 1a, principally
representing catches by the Yemenis fleet. Moderate handline catches are
also taken in regions 1b, 2 and 4, the catch and effort from these
components of the fishery were reassigned to the fishery within region
1a.

For regions 1a and 4, a miscellaneous (``Other'') fishery was defined
comprising catches from artisanal fisheries other than those specified
above (e.g.~trawlers, small purse seines or seine nets, sport fishing
and a range of small gears).

\subsection{Indices}\label{indices}

\subsubsection{Longline CPUE}\label{longline-cpue}

Standardised CPUE indices were derived using generalized linear models
(GLM) from longline catch and effort data (aggregated by month and
1\(^\circ\) grid resolution) provided by Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China
(\citeproc{ref-matsumotoJointLonglineCPUE2024}{Matsumoto et al. 2024}).
Cluster analyses of species composition data for each fleet were used to
separate datasets into fisheries understood to target different species.
Selected clusters were then combined and standardized using generalized
linear models. Yellowfin catch (numbers of fish) was the dependent
variable of the positive catch model (lognormal error structure), while
the presence/absence of yellowfin tuna in the catch was the dependent
variable in the binomial model. In addition to the year-quarter, models
included covariates for 5\(^\circ\) square location, number of hooks,
and vessels (that accounted for 50\% of the total effort). The CPUE for
the temperate regions 2 and 3 incorporated the cluster variable to
indicate the targeting effect, whereas the tropical regions 1 and 4 used
hooks between floats (HBF). The CPUE indices represented the time series
of abundance (1975--2020) for each of the four model regions (1, 2, 3,
and 4). The data from region 1a is not included in the standardization
and the index for region 1b is assumed to index the abundance for the
whole of region 1.

The standardized quarterly CPUE indices included in the assessment are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-comp-cpue}. In general, the overall trends in
the updated CPUE indices are similar to those included in the previous
assessment, but the updated indices in regons 1, 3, and 4 have larger
declines, especially in the early years. For region 3, the updated
analysis is based on an aggregated dataset in which there were fewer
vessels targeting yellowfin tuna and much less catch and effort, so the
information is more scarce
(\citeproc{ref-matsumotoJointLonglineCPUE2024}{Matsumoto et al. 2024}).

For the regional longline fisheries, a common catchability coefficient
(and selectivity) was estimated in the assessment model, thereby,
linking the respective CPUE indices among regions. This significantly
increases the power of the model to estimate the relative (and absolute)
level of biomass among regions. However, as CPUE indices are essentially
density estimates it is necessary to scale the CPUE indices to account
for the relative abundance of the stock among regions. For example, a
relatively small region with a very high average catch rate may have a
lower level of total biomass than a large region with a moderate level
of CPUE.

The approach used was to determine regional scaling factors that
incorporated both the size of the region and the relative catch rate to
estimate the relative level of exploitable longline biomass among
regions. This approach is similar to that used in the Western and
Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) regionally disaggregated
tuna assessments. Hoyle
(\citeproc{ref-hoyleIndianOceanTropical2018}{2018}) proposed a set of
regional weighing factors for IO yellowfin based on aggregated longline
catch effort data. The authors recommended the estimates by method `8'
for the period 1979--1994 (referred to as `7994m8', see Table 2 of Hoyle
(\citeproc{ref-hoyleIndianOceanTropical2018}{2018})) to be included in
the current assessment. The relative scaling factors calculated for
regions 1--4 are 1.674, 0.623, 0.455 and 1.000 respectively.

For each of the principal longline fisheries, the GLM standardized CPUE
index was normalized to the mean of the period for which the region
scaling factors were derived (i.e., the GLM index from 1979--1994). The
normalized GLM index was then scaled by the respective regional scaling
factor to account for the regional differences in the relative level of
exploitable longline biomass among regions

A number of important trends are evident in the CPUE indices:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  1980-1989 the western tropical (region 1b) CPUE increased during the
  1980s, then declined until 1995, increased again until 2005, and then
  decreased again. The low CPUE indices followed the period of
  exceptionally high catches from the purse seine fishery in region 1b
  during 2003--2005. The drop in CPUE occurred before the peak in the
  number of piracy incidents in the western Indian Ocean (2008--2011).
  After that time, it remained close to the lowest level observed but
  showed very large seasonal variations.
\item
  The eastern tropical region 4 followed a similar pattern until 1990
  but then declined steadily, and by 2016 was also close to the lowest
  level in the time series. The recent decline in CPUE in this region is
  consistent with a decline in the proportion of yellowfin in the
  combined tuna catch from the Japanese longline fleet in the eastern
  Indian Ocean (see Figure 44 from Hoyle et al 2015). It is unclear
  whether the change in species proportion is related to a decline in
  the abundance of yellowfin in the region (relative to the other
  species) or a regional change in the targeting of the fishing fleet.
  However, there is an indication that there has been a differential
  shift towards deeper longline gear (greater HBF) in the eastern Indian
  Ocean since 2000 and this may indicate a shift in targeting toward
  bigeye tuna in this region (Hoyle pers. comm. additional JP LL
  analyses). Such factors may not be adequately accounted for in the
  standardisation of the yellowfin CPUE data.
\item
  The CPUE indices in western temperate region 2 followed a similar
  pattern to the western tropical indices, with a decline until the
  late-1970s followed by an increase until the late 1980s, and
  subsequently a slow decline with significant variability. However, the
  two sets of CPUE indices diverge somewhat from about 2007 with the
  CPUE indices from R2 being maintained at a higher level relative to
  R1.
\item
  The CPUE indices from region 3 are low compared to the other three
  regions reflecting the low regional scaling factor. However, the
  overall trend in the CPUE indices is broadly comparable to the other
  regions. The eastern temperate region 3 the pattern was similar to the
  western temperate area before 1979. After 1979 catch rates increased
  until the mid-2000's, but then declined rapidly and reached their
  lowest observed levels by 2016.
\item
  There is an exceptionally high peak in CPUE indices 1976--78. Hoyle et
  al.~(2017) showed that this discontinuity exists in Japanese,
  Taiwanese and Korean data, and in multiple regions in multiple oceans,
  and for both bigeye and yellowfin tuna. Hoyle et al (2017) suggested
  this is unlikely to be explained by changes to the population or
  catchability but may be associated with catch reporting and data
  management.
\item
  The spike in the CPUE indices around 2012 in the west equatorial
  region (region 1) was evident for most fishing fleets. Several
  hypotheses have been proposed on what could have caused CPUE to have
  increased, including a return to fishing in areas that were most
  affected by piracy. However, further investigation is required.
