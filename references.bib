  abstract = {Skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tuna are the target species of tropical tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean, with high commercial value in the international market. High fishing pressure over the past three decades has raised concerns about their sustainability. Understanding life history strategies and stock structure is essential to determine species resilience and how they might respond to exploitation. Here we provide a comprehensive review of available knowledge on the biology, ecology, and stock structure of tropical tuna species in the Indian Ocean. We describe the characteristics of Indian Ocean tropical tuna fisheries and synthesize skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna key life history attributes such as biogeography, trophic ecology, growth, and reproductive biology. In addition, we evaluate the available literature about their stock structure using different approaches such as analysis of fisheries data, genetic markers, otolith microchemistry and tagging, among others. Based on this review, we conclude that there is a clear lack of ocean basin-scale studies on skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna life history, and that regional stock structure studies indicate that the panmictic population assumption of these stocks should be investigated further. Finally, we identify specific knowledge gaps that should be addressed with priority to ensure a sustainable and effective management of these species.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the examination of some reproductive features and stomach contents of yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, were determined by samples taken from Iranian drifting gillnets in the Oman Sea in the years 2007 to 2009. The male to female ratio in overall size was 1 : 0.93, which was not significantly different from the expected value 1 : 1. Fish lengths ranged from 37 to 152 cm, averaging 78.5 cm for females and 79.2 cm for males. At a larger size ({$>$}117 cm) males were proportionally predominant. Length at first maturity, Lm 50\%, was observed when females reached 77.2 cm. Data from maturity stages indicated a single spawning period, peaking in May-June, corresponding with a drop in the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI). Fishes were the main prey group, comprising 47.6\% of total numbers among the three food item categories in the tuna stomachs. Among the 12 families identified in the stomachs, the Portunidae swimming crab crustacean was the most important prey organism (18.7\% of total numbers). A wide range of prey species found in yellowfin tuna stomachs reflects an opportunistic feeding behaviour restricted by local prey availability. Considering the scarcity of available data, the results of the present paper will provide a reference for better knowledge of the biological features of T. albacares in the Oman Sea.},

  abstract = {Indices of abundance based on fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) are important components of many stock assessments, particularly when fishery-independent surveys are unavailable. Standardizing CPUE to develop indices that better reflect the relative abundance requires the analyst to make numerous decisions, which are influenced by factors that include the biology of the study species, the structure of the fishery of interest, the nature of the available data, and the objectives of the analysis such as how standardized data will be used in a subsequent assessment model. Alternative choices can substantially change the index, and hence stock assess\- ment outcomes and management decisions. To guide decisions, we provide advice on good practices in 16 areas, focusing on decision points: fishery definitions, exploring and preparing data, misreporting, data aggregation, density and catchability covariates, environmental variables, combining CPUE and survey data, analysis tools, spatial considerations, setting up and predicting from the model, uncertainty estimation, error distributions, model diagnostics, model selection, multispecies targeting, and using CPUE in stock assessments. Often the most influential outcome of exploring and analysing catch and effort data is that analysts better understand the population and the fishery, thereby improving the stock assessment.},

  abstract = {Though yellowfin tuna (               Thunnus albacares               ) is one of the important fishery resources in the Bay of Bengal, knowledge on its ecology, diet composition and feeding habits are limited from this area. In view of that, present study focuses on the diet composition and feeding habits of yellowfin tuna (YFT) hooked during exploratory longline survey conducted in the Indian EEZ of the Bay of Bengal during 2019--2021. A total of 213 specimens in the length range of 42.0 to 171.0\,cm fork length (FL) were examined, of which 28.2\% were empty while the remaining 71.8\% contained at least one prey item. The modified Costello graphical method shows a wide range of prey items, with a few prey species that are dominant and can be found in high densities in the Bay of Bengal. Due to the fact that this apex predator is a generalist feeder, this might be the case. Cluster analysis based on the               \%IRI               (Index of relative importance) identified two size groups. YFT with smaller ({$<$}80\,cm FL) is one group. Crustaceans was the most frequently eaten prey in that group followed by cephalopods and teleostea. The second group consists of two length groups medium (81--120 FL), and larger ({$>$}120 FL), Cephalopods were the dominant prey items of this group and accounts for 62.0\% in               \%IRI               followed by teleostea 31.3\% of the diet. Cephalopods (               Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis               ) were the primary food consumed in all the size groups, followed by crustaceans (               Charybdis smithii               ) and Teleost fishes (               Cubiceps pauciradiatus               ). The dietary breadth and the occurrence of empty stomachs were significantly related to size of the yellowfin tuna. With increasing body size, diet breadth gradually increased while the percentage of empty stomachs declined. The yellowfin tuna diet does not vary significantly during the seasons. However, cephalopods were found in 53.5\% of the IRI in their diet. Furthermore, there were notable seasonal changes in the percentage of empty stomachs, with the highest percentage observed during the monsoon season (38.3\%).},

Fork length ranges for males and females were 37--186 cm and 33--173.5 cm with a mean of 97.98 cm and 87.46 cm, and the length composition between sexes differed significantly. The sex ratio was 0.68, indicating a preponderance of males in the catch; and this dominance by males was significant in a few months and at fork lengths of 60.0 cm and above. Length at sexual maturity for females and males were 79.91 cm and 81.32 cm. The percentage of spawning females (48.98\,{\textpm}\,3.15 -- 63.46\,{\textpm}\,3.98) and gonadosomatic index for female (1.24\,{\textpm}\,0.10 -- 1.50\,{\textpm}\,0.05) and male (0.83\,{\textpm}\,0.06 -- 1.05\,{\textpm}\,0.08), which differed significantly between months, were higher during October--November and March--April, signifying it to be the peak spawning season. However, spawning was found to occur around the year. Absolute batch fecundity ranged from 0.043178 to 2.670221 million oocytes. Relative batch fecundity was 28.98 ova per gram body weight. The relation between absolute batch fecundity and fork length (FL) and weight was Log F\,=\,-1.8247\,+\,3.7022 Log FL and Log F\,=\,0.1053\,+\,1.2990 Log W. Ova diameter distribution in spawning ripe ovaries indicated multiple modes demonstrating asynchronous gonadal development and batch spawning.

  abstract = {Using Taiwanese longline fishery data, this study investigated the influence of climate variability and environ\- mental conditions in the Indian Ocean on the catch rates and distribution of immature and mature cohorts of yellowfin tuna. The variations in the seasonal distribution of immature and mature cohorts suggest that yellowfin tuna move extensively from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal to the coastal waters of Somalia and around Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The high recruitments of the immature cohort were found in 1998--2002, and the catch rate of the immature and mature cohorts revealed positive associations with periodicities of approx\- imately 3--4 years. We found that the distributions and catch rates of the two cohorts were sensitive to variations in climatic and marine environments. Sea surface temperature was the most influential environmental variable for both cohorts, and Chl-a was not statistically significant for the immature cohort. There was a significant negative correlation between the catch rate of the immature and mature cohort and Indian Ocean Dipoles (IODs), with periodicities of approximately 3 years during the study period, and had periodicities of approximately 1--3 years with El Nin{\textasciitilde}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Furthermore, the influence of IODs exhibited greater variance than that of ENSO events, and the influence of ENSO was only evident near the Arabian Sea. The in\- fluence of concurrent positive IOD and El Nin{\textasciitilde}o events led to lower catch rates for the mature cohort in 2008--2009 in the northwestern Indian Ocean.},

  abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

  abstract = {The movements, and hence stock structures, of bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus, and yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, remain poorly defined despite their importance to food security, livelihoods and government revenue in many nations. We examined the parasite fauna of juvenile bigeye tuna and juvenile yellowfin tuna from areas within and outside Indonesia to determine how far they may have moved since metamorphosis and acquisition of a piscivorous diet. Patterns in parasite data between collection areas were consistent between the two tuna species. Fish from two outlier areas, Maldives and the Solomon Islands, harboured a distinct parasite fauna from those from adjacent Indonesian areas, although occasionally showed similarity with those from within the Indonesian archipelago. Within Indonesia, the parasite data indicated that few juvenile fish moved west from the Pacific Ocean into the archipelago and few moved west from the archipelago into the eastern Indian Ocean. While sampling of adult fish is required to fully resolve the stock structure of both tuna species, the results provide a necessary firststep in examining structuring of the two tuna species in Indonesia and indicate that juveniles of both species may have more restricted movement than is recognized in current management arrangements.},

  abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the `areas-as-fleets' approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the ``integrated approach'' to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

Epipelagic fish are the main prey of these tunas, whereas no vertically migrating fish, which inhabit subsurface layers at night, have been found in their stomachs. These tunas are thus considered day-feeders. Purse-seine-caught tunas, which belong to large schools, have a much higher number of prey-fish in their stomachs than tunas caught by trolling on small schools. Similarly, prey-fish from purse-seine tunas have a much higher number of plank-tonic prey in their stomachs than those from troll-caught tunas. Therefore, these tunas adopt a wandering strategy in small schools when food resources are scarce and form large schools when they are abundant. The planktonic organisms found in the stomachs of prey-fish are described by taxa and sizes; they represent the fraction of the planktonic biomass actually supporting the stock of tuna. Size ratios between the three links tuna-prey-fish-plankton are very high, suggesting that these tunas benefit from a short food chain which is probably efficient from the energetic point of view.},

  abstract = {Numerous pelagic species are known to associate with floating objects (FOBs), including tropical tunas. Purse seiners use this behaviour to facilitate the capture of tropical tunas by deploying artificial drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs). One major recent change has been the integration of echosounders in satellite-tracked GPS buoys attached to FOBs, allowing fishers to remotely estimate fishable biomass. Understanding the effects of this new technology on catch of the three main tuna species (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares; bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus; and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis) is important to accurately correct for this change in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices used for stock assessments. We analysed catch data from the French purse seine fleet for the period 2010--2017 in the Indian Ocean to assess the impact of this fleet's switch to echosounder buoys around 2012. Results indicate that echosounders do not increase the probability a set will be succesful, but they have a positive effect on catch per set, with catches on average increasing by \%2 {\`A} 2:5 tonnes per set (\%10\%) when made on the vessel's own dFADs equipped with an echosounder buoy. Increases were due to a decrease in sets below \%25 tonnes and an increase in those greater than \%25 tonnes, with a non-linear transition around this threshold. This increase explains the considerable investment of purse seiners in echosounder buoys, but also raises concerns about bias in stock size estimates based on CPUE if we do not correct for this fishing efficiency increase.},
