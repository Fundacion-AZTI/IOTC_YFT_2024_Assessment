  abstract = {Estimates of age and growth of yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tuna remain problematic because validation of growth zone deposition (opaque and translucent) has not been properly evaluated. Otolith growth structure (zone clarity) can be poorly defined for tropical tunas, but the use of bomb radiocarbon dating has validated age estimates to 16--18 years for yellowfin and bigeye tuna. Use of the radiocarbon decline period --- defined by regional coral and otoliths --- provided valid ages through ontogeny. Yellowfin tuna aged 2--18 years (n = 34, 1029--1810 mm FL) and bigeye tuna aged 3--17 years (n = 12, 1280--1750 mm FL) led to birth years that were coincident with the bomb radiocarbon decline. The results indicate there was no age reading bias for yellowfin tuna and that age estimates of previous studies were likely underestimated for both species.},

  abstract = {Skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tuna are the target species of tropical tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean, with high commercial value in the international market. High fishing pressure over the past three decades has raised concerns about their sustainability. Understanding life history strategies and stock structure is essential to determine species resilience and how they might respond to exploitation. Here we provide a comprehensive review of available knowledge on the biology, ecology, and stock structure of tropical tuna species in the Indian Ocean. We describe the characteristics of Indian Ocean tropical tuna fisheries and synthesize skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna key life history attributes such as biogeography, trophic ecology, growth, and reproductive biology. In addition, we evaluate the available literature about their stock structure using different approaches such as analysis of fisheries data, genetic markers, otolith microchemistry and tagging, among others. Based on this review, we conclude that there is a clear lack of ocean basin-scale studies on skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna life history, and that regional stock structure studies indicate that the panmictic population assumption of these stocks should be investigated further. Finally, we identify specific knowledge gaps that should be addressed with priority to ensure a sustainable and effective management of these species.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The retrospective problem involves systematic differences in sequential population analysis (SPA) estimates of stock size or some other quantity in a reference year. The differences occur as successively more data are used for estimation, and they appear to be structural biases caused by a mis-specification of the SPA. In some cases the retrospective problem is so severe that the SPA is considered to be too unreliable for stock assessment purposes. There are many possible sources of retrospective patterns, and it is usually difficult in practice to determine which are more likely. We propose diagnostics to help determine the more likely causes. We use local influence diagnostics to investigate whether small changes or perturbations to SPA input components such as catches or natural mortalities can remove or reduce retrospective patterns. We show, for the fall-spawning herring stock in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence SPA, that relatively small age- and year-specific changes to the SPA assumptions about the proportional relationship between an abundance index and stock size can result in greatly reduced retrospective patterns. We therefore conclude primafacie that these assumptions are a plausible source of the retrospective pattern. Larger changes to catches, natural mortality assumptions, or estimation weights are required to reduce the retrospective pattern. These other factors seem to be less plausible sources of the retrospective pattern, although this is best assessed by the herring stock experts who are more knowledgeable about the fishery and other scientific information for this stock.},

  abstract = {A variety of data types can be included in contemporary integrated stock assessments to simultaneously provide information on all estimated parameters. Conflicts between data, which are often a symptom of model misspecification and evident as model misfit, can affect the estimates of important parameters and derived quantities. Unfortunately, there are few standard diagnostic tools available for integrated stock assessment models that can provide the analyst with all the information needed to determine if there is substantial model misspecification. In this study, we use simulation methods to evaluate the ability of commonly-used and recently-proposed diagnostic tests to detect model misspecification in the observation model process (i.e., the incorrect form for survey selectivity), systems dynamics (i.e., incorrect assumed values for steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship and natural mortality), and incorrect data weighting. The diagnostic tests evaluated here were: i) residuals analysis (SDNR and runs test); ii) retrospective analysis; iii) the R0 likelihood component profile; iv) the age-structured production model (ASPM); and v) catch-curve analysis (CCA). The efficacy of the diagnostic tests depended on whether the misspecification was in the observation or systems dynamics model. Residual analyses were easily the best detector of misspecification of the observation model while the ASPM test was the only good diagnostic for detecting misspecification of system dynamics model. Retrospective analysis and the R0 likelihood component profile infrequently detected misspecified models, and CCA had a high probability of rejecting correctly-specified models. Finally, applying multiple carefully selected diagnostics can increase the power to detect misspecification without substantially increasing the probability of falsely concluding there is misspecification when the model is correctly specified.},

A few previous studies have reported biased and imprecise assessment model outcomes when variability in somatic growth was ignored. In this study, we used a simulation-estimation framework to expand previous analyses and to examine the consequences of ignoring or incorporating spatial and temporal (year- and cohort-specific) variability in somatic growth in stock assessment models. The study included three life history types: small pelagic (e.g. sardine), gadids (e.g. cod), and long-lived (e.g. rockfish). In general, ignoring any type of variability in somatic growth led to biased and imprecise estimates of stock spawning biomass and management quantities. Unequal distribution of fishing mortality across space had large impacts on the performance of estimation models as well. Conversely, accounting for somatic growth variability, either by including an environmental index, estimating annual deviates, or implementing a spatially explicit model, produced unbiased and precise results. This study shows that somatic growth variability might produce large effects in stock assessments when ignored and provides pertinent information for stock assessment best practice guidelines.},

Age estimation techniques need to be validated at the population level to ensure accuracy. However, otolith-based age estimates of yellowfin tuna have never been validated in the Indian Ocean. The current study provides the first age validation for Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna using the post-peak decline period of the bomb radiocarbon (14C) chronometer. A 14C reference chronology based on accelerator mass spectrometry assays of known-age yellowfin tuna otoliths was consistent with published regional coral records, with all showing similar rates of decline during the 2000 to 2019 study period. After backcalculating the birth years of sub-adult and adult yellowfin tuna from otolith increment counts, {$\Delta$}14C values measured in the early growth portion of the otolith were compared with the observed decline slope of the reference chronology. There were no significant differences between the birth years of validation and reference samples, supporting the otolith increment age determination methodology between the ages of 2.2 and 10.5 yr. The validation of age and growth estimates is expected to benefit assessment models for Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna. We recommend that otoliths from large fish continue to be collected to expand the validation to older fish. Greater precision in the validation results will also require a larger reference chronology.},

I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

  abstract = {The need for sound ecological science has escalated alongside the rise of the information age and ``big data'' across all sectors of society. Big data generally refer to massive volumes of data not readily handled by the usual data tools and practices and present unprecedented opportunities for advancing science and informing resource management through data-intensive approaches. The era of big data need not be propelled only by ``big science'' -- the term used to describe large-scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual-driven culture of ecology. Collectively, ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort -- a large volume of distributed, high-value information -- but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power. The scientists who contribute such information will be at the forefront of socially relevant science -- but will they be ecologists?},

The concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers, constitutes ``open science.'' Despite the many benefits of an open approach to science, a number of barriers to entry exist that may prevent researchers from embracing openness in their own work. Here we describe several key shifts in mindset that underpin the transition to more open science. These shifts in mindset include thinking about data stewardship rather than data ownership, embracing transparency throughout the data life-cycle and project duration, and accepting critique in public. Though foreign and perhaps frightening at first, these changes in thinking stand to benefit the field of ecology by fostering collegiality and broadening access to data and findings. We present an overview of tools and best practices that can enable these shifts in mindset at each stage of the research process, including tools to support data management planning and reproducible analyses, strategies for soliciting constructive feedback throughout the research process, and methods of broadening access to final research products.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the examination of some reproductive features and stomach contents of yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, were determined by samples taken from Iranian drifting gillnets in the Oman Sea in the years 2007 to 2009. The male to female ratio in overall size was 1 : 0.93, which was not significantly different from the expected value 1 : 1. Fish lengths ranged from 37 to 152 cm, averaging 78.5 cm for females and 79.2 cm for males. At a larger size ({$>$}117 cm) males were proportionally predominant. Length at first maturity, Lm 50\%, was observed when females reached 77.2 cm. Data from maturity stages indicated a single spawning period, peaking in May-June, corresponding with a drop in the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI). Fishes were the main prey group, comprising 47.6\% of total numbers among the three food item categories in the tuna stomachs. Among the 12 families identified in the stomachs, the Portunidae swimming crab crustacean was the most important prey organism (18.7\% of total numbers). A wide range of prey species found in yellowfin tuna stomachs reflects an opportunistic feeding behaviour restricted by local prey availability. Considering the scarcity of available data, the results of the present paper will provide a reference for better knowledge of the biological features of T. albacares in the Oman Sea.},

  abstract = {Indices of abundance based on fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) are important components of many stock assessments, particularly when fishery-independent surveys are unavailable. Standardizing CPUE to develop indices that better reflect the relative abundance requires the analyst to make numerous decisions, which are influenced by factors that include the biology of the study species, the structure of the fishery of interest, the nature of the available data, and the objectives of the analysis such as how standardized data will be used in a subsequent assessment model. Alternative choices can substantially change the index, and hence stock assess\- ment outcomes and management decisions. To guide decisions, we provide advice on good practices in 16 areas, focusing on decision points: fishery definitions, exploring and preparing data, misreporting, data aggregation, density and catchability covariates, environmental variables, combining CPUE and survey data, analysis tools, spatial considerations, setting up and predicting from the model, uncertainty estimation, error distributions, model diagnostics, model selection, multispecies targeting, and using CPUE in stock assessments. Often the most influential outcome of exploring and analysing catch and effort data is that analysts better understand the population and the fishery, thereby improving the stock assessment.},

In view of that, present study focuses on the diet composition and feeding habits of yellowfin tuna (YFT) hooked during exploratory longline survey conducted in the Indian EEZ of the Bay of Bengal during 2019--2021. A total of 213 specimens in the length range of 42.0 to 171.0\,cm fork length (FL) were examined, of which 28.2\% were empty while the remaining 71.8\% contained at least one prey item. The modified Costello graphical method shows a wide range of prey items, with a few prey species that are dominant and can be found in high densities in the Bay of Bengal. Due to the fact that this apex predator is a generalist feeder, this might be the case. Cluster analysis based on the               \%IRI               (Index of relative importance) identified two size groups. YFT with smaller ({$<$}80\,cm FL) is one group. Crustaceans was the most frequently eaten prey in that group followed by cephalopods and teleostea. The second group consists of two length groups medium (81--120 FL), and larger ({$>$}120 FL), Cephalopods were the dominant prey items of this group and accounts for 62.0\% in               \%IRI               followed by teleostea 31.3\% of the diet. Cephalopods (               Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis               ) were the primary food consumed in all the size groups, followed by crustaceans (               Charybdis smithii               ) and Teleost fishes (               Cubiceps pauciradiatus               ). The dietary breadth and the occurrence of empty stomachs were significantly related to size of the yellowfin tuna. With increasing body size, diet breadth gradually increased while the percentage of empty stomachs declined. The yellowfin tuna diet does not vary significantly during the seasons. However, cephalopods were found in 53.5\% of the IRI in their diet. Furthermore, there were notable seasonal changes in the percentage of empty stomachs, with the highest percentage observed during the monsoon season (38.3\%).},

Fork length ranges for males and females were 37--186 cm and 33--173.5 cm with a mean of 97.98 cm and 87.46 cm, and the length composition between sexes differed significantly. The sex ratio was 0.68, indicating a preponderance of males in the catch; and this dominance by males was significant in a few months and at fork lengths of 60.0 cm and above. Length at sexual maturity for females and males were 79.91 cm and 81.32 cm. The percentage of spawning females (48.98\,{\textpm}\,3.15 -- 63.46\,{\textpm}\,3.98) and gonadosomatic index for female (1.24\,{\textpm}\,0.10 -- 1.50\,{\textpm}\,0.05) and male (0.83\,{\textpm}\,0.06 -- 1.05\,{\textpm}\,0.08), which differed significantly between months, were higher during October--November and March--April, signifying it to be the peak spawning season. However, spawning was found to occur around the year. Absolute batch fecundity ranged from 0.043178 to 2.670221 million oocytes. Relative batch fecundity was 28.98 ova per gram body weight. The relation between absolute batch fecundity and fork length (FL) and weight was Log F\,=\,-1.8247\,+\,3.7022 Log FL and Log F\,=\,0.1053\,+\,1.2990 Log W. Ova diameter distribution in spawning ripe ovaries indicated multiple modes demonstrating asynchronous gonadal development and batch spawning.

  abstract = {Using Taiwanese longline fishery data, this study investigated the influence of climate variability and environ\- mental conditions in the Indian Ocean on the catch rates and distribution of immature and mature cohorts of yellowfin tuna. The variations in the seasonal distribution of immature and mature cohorts suggest that yellowfin tuna move extensively from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal to the coastal waters of Somalia and around Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The high recruitments of the immature cohort were found in 1998--2002, and the catch rate of the immature and mature cohorts revealed positive associations with periodicities of approx\- imately 3--4 years. We found that the distributions and catch rates of the two cohorts were sensitive to variations in climatic and marine environments. Sea surface temperature was the most influential environmental variable for both cohorts, and Chl-a was not statistically significant for the immature cohort. There was a significant negative correlation between the catch rate of the immature and mature cohort and Indian Ocean Dipoles (IODs), with periodicities of approximately 3 years during the study period, and had periodicities of approximately 1--3 years with El Nin{\textasciitilde}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Furthermore, the influence of IODs exhibited greater variance than that of ENSO events, and the influence of ENSO was only evident near the Arabian Sea. The in\- fluence of concurrent positive IOD and El Nin{\textasciitilde}o events led to lower catch rates for the mature cohort in 2008--2009 in the northwestern Indian Ocean.},

  abstract = {Integrated population dynamics models use a variety of data types, and all the data used impact modeled processes and estimated dynamics. Paired age-length data treated as conditional age-at-length (CAAL) data are increasingly being used as a data component in stock assessment models. The original intent of the use of CAAL data was to directly estimate the length-at-age process, including the associated variability in length-at-age. However, we show that introduction of CAAL data that are not representative of the age-structure of the population can cause bias and imprecision in estimates of not only growth, but also dynamics and management quantities. Estimation of an appropriate age-based observations-modeled process may improve model performance. We also show that even the use of representative CAAL data in a model with misspecified age-based systems-modeled processes (natural mortality and time-varying growth) can lead to bias and imprecision in growth, dynamics, and management quantities. In these cases, estimation of an age-based observations-modeled process magnified the bias and imprecision. Greater consideration of this type of data is needed.},

  abstract = {The population dynamics of fisheries stock enhancement, and its potential for generating benefits over and above those obtainable from optimal exploitation of wild stocks alone are poorly understood and highly controversial. I review pertinent knowledge of fish population biology, and extend the dynamic pool theory of fishing to stock enhancement by unpacking recruitment, incorporating regulation in the recruited stock, and accounting for biological differences between wild and hatchery fish. I then analyse the dynamics of stock enhancement and its potential role in fisheries management, using the candidate stock of North Sea sole as an example and considering economic as well as biological criteria. Enhancement through release of recruits or advanced juveniles is predicted to increase total yield and stock abundance, but reduce abundance of the naturally recruited stock component through compensatory responses or overfishing. Economic feasibility of enhancement is subject to strong constraints, including trade--offs between the costs of fishing and hatchery releases. Costs of hatchery fish strongly influence optimal policy, which may range from no enhancement at high cost to high levels of stocking and fishing effort at low cost. Release of genetically maladapted fish reduces the effectiveness of enhancement, and is most detrimental overall if fitness of hatchery fish is only moderately compromised. As a temporary measure for the rebuilding of depleted stocks, enhancement cannot substitute for effort limitation, and is advantageous as an auxiliary measure only if the population has been reduced to a very low proportion of its unexploited biomass. Quantitative analysis of population dynamics is central to the responsible use of stock enhancement in fisheries management, and the necessary tools are available.},

  abstract = {The relationship between body weight and natural mortality in juvenile and adult fish was analysed for different aquatic ecosystems: lakes, rivers, the ocean, and pond, cage and tank aquaculture systems. Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters               b               (exponent) and                                M                 u                              (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters               b               =-0.288 (90\% CL[-0.315, -0.261]) and                                M                 u                              =3.00 (90\% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year               -1               . Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about               b               =-0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year               -1               ) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year               -1               ), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed.},

We first review published data and give new results showing that key reference points are fixed when steepness and other life history parameters are fixed in stock assessments using a Beverton--Holt stock--recruitment relationship. We use both production and age-structured models to explore these patterns. For the production model, we derive explicit relationships for steepness and life history parameters and then for steepness and major reference points. For the age-structured model, we are required to generally use numerical computation, and so we provide an example that complements the analytical results of the production model. We discuss what it means to set steepness equal to 1 and how to construct a prior for steepness. Ways out of the difficult situation raised by fixing steepness and life history parameters include not fixing them, using a more complicated stock--recruitment relationship, and being more explicit about the information content of the data and what that means for policy makers. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

We examined the parasite fauna of juvenile bigeye tuna and juvenile yellowfin tuna from areas within and outside Indonesia to determine how far they may have moved since metamorphosis and acquisition of a piscivorous diet. Patterns in parasite data between collection areas were consistent between the two tuna species. Fish from two outlier areas, Maldives and the Solomon Islands, harboured a distinct parasite fauna from those from adjacent Indonesian areas, although occasionally showed similarity with those from within the Indonesian archipelago. Within Indonesia, the parasite data indicated that few juvenile fish moved west from the Pacific Ocean into the archipelago and few moved west from the archipelago into the eastern Indian Ocean. While sampling of adult fish is required to fully resolve the stock structure of both tuna species, the results provide a necessary firststep in examining structuring of the two tuna species in Indonesia and indicate that juveniles of both species may have more restricted movement than is recognized in current management arrangements.},

During 2004--2017, 3,443 Yellowfin Tuna were sampled, primarily from recreational landings off the coast of Louisiana (90\%). Based on reading otoliths, ages ranged from 1 to 18~years, with younger fish ({$<$}4~years) representing the majority (78\%) of the age-classes. Otolith weight was allometrically related to fish age (               r               2               = 0.91), which suggests that it may be a useful tool in indirectly estimating age given the challenges associated with directly aging tropical tunas. Based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the Richards growth model had the most parsimonious fit to the length-at-age data (average maximum length               L               {$\infty$}               ~=~1,658~mm, growth coefficient               k               ~=~0.23~year               -1               ,               a               ~=~1.04,               b               ~=~0.45) compared to the von Bertalanffy growth model (               L               {$\infty$}               ~=~1,589~mm,               k               ~=~0.36~year               -1               , theoretical age at zero length               t               0               ~=~-0.8~year; AIC difference~=~26.21), which had a relatively poor fit. The size-modified Richards model, which assumed a truncated error structure at the minimum size limit (686~mm curved fork length [CFL]) in fishery-dependent collections, improved the fit in the smallest individuals and was therefore the preferred model. Males and females had similar maximum ages (18 and 17~years, respectively) but showed significant differences in growth, with males reaching a larger               L               {$\infty$}               than females (size-modified Richards: 1,706 versus 1,568~mm CFL, respectively). Baseline natural mortality (               M               ) using a maximum age of 18~years was 0.346 and was then scaled across age-classes. These growth and mortality estimates and the individual age data have been used in improving stock assessments for Yellowfin Tuna to support scientific management.},

  abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the `areas-as-fleets' approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the ``integrated approach'' to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

  abstract = {Scientists across many fields are faced with the challenge of synthesizing and communicating information from large and complex data sets. The field of stock assessment is no exception as the volume and variety of the data has grown alongside the computational methods used to integrate them. While this growth in data and model complexity has improved many stock assessments, the process of communicating key results to colleagues and stakeholders in a meaningful way has become more daunting. The traditional approach of presenting information across a series of static slides often fails to convey the richness of information available, and as such, important patterns and details are easily overlooked. Here we contend that this problem can be mediated through the effective use of new open source tools for building interactive visualizations. These tools allow a broader audience to conduct detailed explorations of the results, leading to a deeper and collective understanding of both the data and models used to inform stock assessments. As a consequence, the peer review process is more open and accessible.},

Epipelagic fish are the main prey of these tunas, whereas no vertically migrating fish, which inhabit subsurface layers at night, have been found in their stomachs. These tunas are thus considered day-feeders. Purse-seine-caught tunas, which belong to large schools, have a much higher number of prey-fish in their stomachs than tunas caught by trolling on small schools. Similarly, prey-fish from purse-seine tunas have a much higher number of plank-tonic prey in their stomachs than those from troll-caught tunas. Therefore, these tunas adopt a wandering strategy in small schools when food resources are scarce and form large schools when they are abundant. The planktonic organisms found in the stomachs of prey-fish are described by taxa and sizes; they represent the fraction of the planktonic biomass actually supporting the stock of tuna. Size ratios between the three links tuna-prey-fish-plankton are very high, suggesting that these tunas benefit from a short food chain which is probably efficient from the energetic point of view.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many methods have been developed in the last 70 years to predict the natural mortality rate, M, of a stock based on empirical evidence from comparative life history studies. These indirect or empirical methods are used in most stock assessments to (i) obtain estimates of M in the absence of direct information, (ii) check on the reasonableness of a direct estimate of M, (iii) examine the range of plausible M estimates for the stock under consideration, and (iv) define prior distributions for Bayesian analyses. The two most cited empirical methods have appeared in the literature over 2500 times to date. Despite the importance of these methods, there is no consensus in the literature on how well these methods work in terms of prediction error or how their performance may be ranked. We evaluate estimators based on various combinations of maximum age (tmax), growth parameters, and water temperature by seeing how well they reproduce \&gt;200 independent, direct estimates of M. We use tenfold cross-validation to estimate the prediction error of the estimators and to rank their performance. With updated and carefully reviewed data, we conclude that a tmax-based estimator performs the best among all estimators evaluated. The tmax-based estimators in turn perform better than the Alverson--Carney method based on tmax and the von Bertalanffy K coefficient, Pauly's method based on growth parameters and water temperature and methods based just on K. It is possible to combine two independent methods by computing a weighted mean but the improvement over the tmax-based methods is slight. Based on cross-validation prediction error, model residual patterns, model parsimony, and biological considerations, we recommend the use of a tmax-based estimator (M=4.899tmax-0.916, prediction error = 0.32) when possible and a growth-based method (M=4.118K0.73L{$\infty-$}0.33 , prediction error = 0.6, length in cm) otherwise.},

  abstract = {Numerous pelagic species are known to associate with floating objects (FOBs), including tropical tunas. Purse seiners use this behaviour to facilitate the capture of tropical tunas by deploying artificial drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs). One major recent change has been the integration of echosounders in satellite-tracked GPS buoys attached to FOBs, allowing fishers to remotely estimate fishable biomass. Understanding the effects of this new technology on catch of the three main tuna species (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares; bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus; and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis) is important to accurately correct for this change in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices used for stock assessments. We analysed catch data from the French purse seine fleet for the period 2010--2017 in the Indian Ocean to assess the impact of this fleet's switch to echosounder buoys around 2012. Results indicate that echosounders do not increase the probability a set will be succesful, but they have a positive effect on catch per set, with catches on average increasing by \%2 {\`A} 2:5 tonnes per set (\%10\%) when made on the vessel's own dFADs equipped with an echosounder buoy. Increases were due to a decrease in sets below \%25 tonnes and an increase in those greater than \%25 tonnes, with a non-linear transition around this threshold. This increase explains the considerable investment of purse seiners in echosounder buoys, but also raises concerns about bias in stock size estimates based on CPUE if we do not correct for this fishing efficiency increase.},
