  abstract = {Skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tuna are the target species of tropical tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean, with high commercial value in the international market. High fishing pressure over the past three decades has raised concerns about their sustainability. Understanding life history strategies and stock structure is essential to determine species resilience and how they might respond to exploitation. Here we provide a comprehensive review of available knowledge on the biology, ecology, and stock structure of tropical tuna species in the Indian Ocean. We describe the characteristics of Indian Ocean tropical tuna fisheries and synthesize skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna key life history attributes such as biogeography, trophic ecology, growth, and reproductive biology. In addition, we evaluate the available literature about their stock structure using different approaches such as analysis of fisheries data, genetic markers, otolith microchemistry and tagging, among others. Based on this review, we conclude that there is a clear lack of ocean basin-scale studies on skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna life history, and that regional stock structure studies indicate that the panmictic population assumption of these stocks should be investigated further. Finally, we identify specific knowledge gaps that should be addressed with priority to ensure a sustainable and effective management of these species.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the examination of some reproductive features and stomach contents of yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, were determined by samples taken from Iranian drifting gillnets in the Oman Sea in the years 2007 to 2009. The male to female ratio in overall size was 1 : 0.93, which was not significantly different from the expected value 1 : 1. Fish lengths ranged from 37 to 152 cm, averaging 78.5 cm for females and 79.2 cm for males. At a larger size ({$>$}117 cm) males were proportionally predominant. Length at first maturity, Lm 50\%, was observed when females reached 77.2 cm. Data from maturity stages indicated a single spawning period, peaking in May-June, corresponding with a drop in the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI). Fishes were the main prey group, comprising 47.6\% of total numbers among the three food item categories in the tuna stomachs. Among the 12 families identified in the stomachs, the Portunidae swimming crab crustacean was the most important prey organism (18.7\% of total numbers). A wide range of prey species found in yellowfin tuna stomachs reflects an opportunistic feeding behaviour restricted by local prey availability. Considering the scarcity of available data, the results of the present paper will provide a reference for better knowledge of the biological features of T. albacares in the Oman Sea.},

  abstract = {Though yellowfin tuna (               Thunnus albacares               ) is one of the important fishery resources in the Bay of Bengal, knowledge on its ecology, diet composition and feeding habits are limited from this area. In view of that, present study focuses on the diet composition and feeding habits of yellowfin tuna (YFT) hooked during exploratory longline survey conducted in the Indian EEZ of the Bay of Bengal during 2019--2021. A total of 213 specimens in the length range of 42.0 to 171.0\,cm fork length (FL) were examined, of which 28.2\% were empty while the remaining 71.8\% contained at least one prey item. The modified Costello graphical method shows a wide range of prey items, with a few prey species that are dominant and can be found in high densities in the Bay of Bengal. Due to the fact that this apex predator is a generalist feeder, this might be the case. Cluster analysis based on the               \%IRI               (Index of relative importance) identified two size groups. YFT with smaller ({$<$}80\,cm FL) is one group. Crustaceans was the most frequently eaten prey in that group followed by cephalopods and teleostea. The second group consists of two length groups medium (81--120 FL), and larger ({$>$}120 FL), Cephalopods were the dominant prey items of this group and accounts for 62.0\% in               \%IRI               followed by teleostea 31.3\% of the diet. Cephalopods (               Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis               ) were the primary food consumed in all the size groups, followed by crustaceans (               Charybdis smithii               ) and Teleost fishes (               Cubiceps pauciradiatus               ). The dietary breadth and the occurrence of empty stomachs were significantly related to size of the yellowfin tuna. With increasing body size, diet breadth gradually increased while the percentage of empty stomachs declined. The yellowfin tuna diet does not vary significantly during the seasons. However, cephalopods were found in 53.5\% of the IRI in their diet. Furthermore, there were notable seasonal changes in the percentage of empty stomachs, with the highest percentage observed during the monsoon season (38.3\%).},

  abstract = {The reproductive biology of Thunnus albacares was studied from the western Bay of Bengal during 2012--2015. Fork length ranges for males and females were 37--186 cm and 33--173.5 cm with a mean of 97.98 cm and 87.46 cm, and the length composition between sexes differed significantly. The sex ratio was 0.68, indicating a preponderance of males in the catch; and this dominance by males was significant in a few months and at fork lengths of 60.0 cm and above. Length at sexual maturity for females and males were 79.91 cm and 81.32 cm. The percentage of spawning females (48.98\,{\textpm}\,3.15 -- 63.46\,{\textpm}\,3.98) and gonadosomatic index for female (1.24\,{\textpm}\,0.10 -- 1.50\,{\textpm}\,0.05) and male (0.83\,{\textpm}\,0.06 -- 1.05\,{\textpm}\,0.08), which differed significantly between months, were higher during October--November and March--April, signifying it to be the peak spawning season. However, spawning was found to occur around the year. Absolute batch fecundity ranged from 0.043178 to 2.670221 million oocytes. Relative batch fecundity was 28.98 ova per gram body weight. The relation between absolute batch fecundity and fork length (FL) and weight was Log F\,=\,-1.8247\,+\,3.7022 Log FL and Log F\,=\,0.1053\,+\,1.2990 Log W. Ova diameter distribution in spawning ripe ovaries indicated multiple modes demonstrating asynchronous gonadal development and batch spawning. The present study on the reproductive biology of Thunnus albacares is the first in-detailed comprehensive one, from the western Bay of Bengal and would contribute significantly to its stock management.},

  abstract = {Using Taiwanese longline fishery data, this study investigated the influence of climate variability and environ\- mental conditions in the Indian Ocean on the catch rates and distribution of immature and mature cohorts of yellowfin tuna. The variations in the seasonal distribution of immature and mature cohorts suggest that yellowfin tuna move extensively from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal to the coastal waters of Somalia and around Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The high recruitments of the immature cohort were found in 1998--2002, and the catch rate of the immature and mature cohorts revealed positive associations with periodicities of approx\- imately 3--4 years. We found that the distributions and catch rates of the two cohorts were sensitive to variations in climatic and marine environments. Sea surface temperature was the most influential environmental variable for both cohorts, and Chl-a was not statistically significant for the immature cohort. There was a significant negative correlation between the catch rate of the immature and mature cohort and Indian Ocean Dipoles (IODs), with periodicities of approximately 3 years during the study period, and had periodicities of approximately 1--3 years with El Nin{\textasciitilde}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Furthermore, the influence of IODs exhibited greater variance than that of ENSO events, and the influence of ENSO was only evident near the Arabian Sea. The in\- fluence of concurrent positive IOD and El Nin{\textasciitilde}o events led to lower catch rates for the mature cohort in 2008--2009 in the northwestern Indian Ocean.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

We examined the parasite fauna of juvenile bigeye tuna and juvenile yellowfin tuna from areas within and outside Indonesia to determine how far they may have moved since metamorphosis and acquisition of a piscivorous diet. Patterns in parasite data between collection areas were consistent between the two tuna species. Fish from two outlier areas, Maldives and the Solomon Islands, harboured a distinct parasite fauna from those from adjacent Indonesian areas, although occasionally showed similarity with those from within the Indonesian archipelago. Within Indonesia, the parasite data indicated that few juvenile fish moved west from the Pacific Ocean into the archipelago and few moved west from the archipelago into the eastern Indian Ocean. While sampling of adult fish is required to fully resolve the stock structure of both tuna species, the results provide a necessary firststep in examining structuring of the two tuna species in Indonesia and indicate that juveniles of both species may have more restricted movement than is recognized in current management arrangements.},

Epipelagic fish are the main prey of these tunas, whereas no vertically migrating fish, which inhabit subsurface layers at night, have been found in their stomachs. These tunas are thus considered day-feeders. Purse-seine-caught tunas, which belong to large schools, have a much higher number of prey-fish in their stomachs than tunas caught by trolling on small schools. Similarly, prey-fish from purse-seine tunas have a much higher number of plank-tonic prey in their stomachs than those from troll-caught tunas. Therefore, these tunas adopt a wandering strategy in small schools when food resources are scarce and form large schools when they are abundant. The planktonic organisms found in the stomachs of prey-fish are described by taxa and sizes; they represent the fraction of the planktonic biomass actually supporting the stock of tuna. Size ratios between the three links tuna-prey-fish-plankton are very high, suggesting that these tunas benefit from a short food chain which is probably efficient from the energetic point of view.},
