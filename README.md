> The main goal of this repository is to replicate the 2024 Indian Ocean yellowfin assessment configurations in R. The assessment is implemented in [Stock Synthesis 3](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis).

This is the developers' branch. If you want to reproduce this assessment, see the `reproducible` branch: <https://github.com/Fundacion-AZTI/IOTC_YFT_2024_Assessment/tree/reproducible>.

## Basic steps to use Github

If you are unfamiliar with Github, these are the first steps that you need to do:

1.  Create a Github account [here](https://github.com).
2.  The simplest way to manage your files (on Windows) is to use [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop).
3.  Clone this repository. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

If you followed these steps, you will now have all the files of this repository locally (i.e., in your computer). Now you can start making changes to existing files or adding new files.

Every time you want to make a new change (assuming you are already a collaborator in this repository), you must follow the following steps:

1.  `git pull` to have all the updates that other people could have made. It is highly recommended to `git pull` the repository regularly and before making any change. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/syncing-your-branch-in-github-desktop#pulling-to-your-local-branch-from-the-remote).
2.  `git commit` to record changes to one or more files, and it is done after you have made the desired change. Write a short description of the change. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop#write-a-commit-message-and-push-your-changes).
3.  After you are done with the `git commit`, you need to `git push` your changes to make them available to all the collaborators. You can check that your changes have been successfully uploaded to the repository by examining the Github repository site.
