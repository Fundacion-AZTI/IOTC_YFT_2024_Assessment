## Reproducibility and transparency

Advantages of making an assessment process reproducible [@magnussonOpenReproducibleFisheries2022]:

- Easy to review the assessment process
- Easy to make updates
- Easy to make modifications
- Improve traceability and credibility of the assessment process

::: fragment

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Anyone can reproduce this assessment process. See instructions: <https://github.com/Fundacion-AZTI/IOTC_YFT_2024_Assessment/tree/reproducible>.

## Background

::: incremental

- 2018 assessment: spatially explicit implemented in Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) [@fuPreliminaryIndianOcean2018].
- An external review was performed in 2019, which provided recommendations to improve the assessment [@methotRecommendationsConfigurationIndian2019], some explored in @urtizbereaPreliminaryAssessmentIndian2019.
- 2021 assessment: based on the 2018 assessment, with some improvements and new analyses [@fuPreliminaryIndianYellowfin2021].
- An external review was carried out in 2023 [@maunderIndependentReviewRecent2023], which provided recommendations for the next assessment, some explored by @langleyInvestigationRecruitmentDynamics2023.

## Fisheries

Nine fishery groups were defined in the assessment:

# Data inputs: Size

## Size

<br> 

::: incremental

- Information provided by year, month, $5\times 5^\circ$ grid, fleet, gear type, type of school, reporting quality, and the number of sampled fish per length bin. 
- Length bins spanned from 10 to 340 cm, with length bin width of 2 cm &rarr standardized from 10 to 198 cm, with length bin width of 4 cm.
- Grids at two spatial resolutions: *original* and *cwp55*.

## Size: filtering

<br>

In general, removed size information by fleets with inconsistent patterns (e.g., low sampling, unrealistic very large fish).

- *LL*: removed data from Taiwan and Seychelles, as well as size information before 1960 [@hoyleReviewSizeData2021].

## Size: filtering

*HD* fishery:

- Oman contributes to a large portion of the catch

## Size: aggregation

<br>

When aggregating by year, quarter, and fishery:

- *Simple aggregation*: summing the number of fish per length bin. Used in 2021 assessment, and assumed that the collection of samples was broadly representative of the
operation of the fishery in each quarter.

- *Catch-raised aggregation*: catch-weighted sum of the number of fish per length bin.

## Tagging

Settings as in the 2021 assessment:

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

- **Initial tagging mortality**: the number of tags in each release group was reduced by 27.5% to account for initial tag mortality [@hoyleCovariatesReleaseMortality2015].
- **Chronic tag loss**: annual rate of 3% [@gaertnerTagSheddingTropical2015].
- **Reporting rate**: high variability over the years. Number of tag recoveries were corrected based on previous studies [@hillaryReportingRateAnalyses2008], and assumed a 100% recovery rate for purse seine fisheries in the model. Estimated for other fisheries.
- **Mixing period**: 4 quarters.

# Model parameters: Population dynamics

## Population dynamics

<br>

- Ages in the model: 0-28+ quarters (i.e., 7 years), but also investigated 0-40+.
- Length bins in the population: 10 to 198 cm, with length bin width of 4 cm.

# Model parameters: Recruitment

## Recruitment

::: incremental 

- Stock-recruitment relationship (SSR): Beverton-Holt.
- Recruitment happens at the beginning of every quarter. 
- Steepness ($h$): 0.8, but other values also tested.
- Recruitment variability ($\sigma_R$): 0.6.
- Recruitment deviates from 1977 to 2021.
- SSR is global, but recruits apportioned into two regions: R1 and R4 [@regleroWorldwideDistributionsTuna2014]. Other options also explored.
- Spatial apportionment of recruits had two time blocks (1977-2008 and 2009-2021).

# Model parameters: Growth

## Growth

New growth curve estimated by @farleyUpdatingEstimationAge2023 based on daily and annual otolith readings validated with radiocarbon [@fraileAgeValidationYellowfin2024]. Approximated in SS3 by varying the age-specific $k$ parameter.

```{r}

# Model parameters: Sexual maturity

## Sexual maturity

# Model parameters: Natural mortality

## Natural mortality

$M_{ref}$ function of the maximum age. $M_{ref}$ corresponded to the age at 95% maturity. Then, $M_{ref}$ was rescaled per age and was a function of growth parameters [@lorenzenPopulationDynamicsPotential2005].

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(shrpoint_path, 'output/figures', "natmort.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

# Model parameters: Movement

## Movement

Specified movement definitions as in the 2021 assessment. Differentiated movement rates between ages 2-8 quarters and older than 9.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(shrpoint_path, 'output/figures', "map_IO_4ARegions_mov.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

# Model parameters: Fishery dynamics

## Fishing mortality

<br>

Modelled using the hybrid method, which uses the Pope’s equation and an iterative method to approximate the fishing mortality ($F$).

## Catchability

<br>

Since regional scaling was performed, we only estimated $Q$ for CPUE LL 1b. The estimated $Q$ was used for LL 2, LL 3, and LL 4.

## Selectivity
